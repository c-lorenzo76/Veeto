### Issues
Currently it is somewhat working. 
Having issues with navigating. 
When I start the game from Lobby and it navigates I lose connection of the socket and therefore deletes lobbies[code]. 
Need to figure out how to maintain that when navigating might have to resolve by rewriting useSocket and UserContext.

# Veeto

## Motivation
Veeto was inspired by the many instances when my partner and I struggled to decide where to eat, 
often spending more time second-guessing our options than enjoying a meal. 
Our indecisiveness led me to create a solutionâ€”a website designed to help simplify the decision-making process. 
Unlike existing tools that merely list nearby restaurants, Veeto takes user preferences into account to make a tailored recommendation. 
My goal is for others who face the same dilemma to find this platform just as helpful.

### Issues

09/04 <br>
I fixed the issue of only the host being redirected to Questions page. I now need to add the voting
implementation. After I need to adjust it to become a multi step form. Once those two things are in play 
I can make it show the results from the poll. Have it display places to eat according to the responses 
May need to create a new Google account to be able to make requests based off coordinates or see other 
API uses. Maybe don't even need that an could use TripAdvisor API.

Okay I believe I fixed the issue with navigating and maintaining the connection of the socket. Had some issues resolving that but now I am able to continue 
to navigate without any hiccups. I might have to refactor my code as its all over the place. I also have lots of unnecessary
functions and emit that don't amount to nothing. So before we work on Questions.jsx tomorrow. I'll fix those issues first.

Currently it is somewhat working. 
Having issues with navigating. 
When I start the game from Lobby and it navigates I lose connection of the socket and therefore deletes lobbies[code]. 
Need to figure out how to maintain that when navigating might have to resolve by rewriting useSocket and UserContext.
